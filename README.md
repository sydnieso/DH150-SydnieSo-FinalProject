# CHARITY MILES

## Design Problem
Finding time to maintain a fitness routine while balancing a busy schedule and striving to help others is a common challenge that young, working individuals have. 
With the jam-packed schedules and fast paced lifestyles that many young adults have in order to balance their work and social lives, helping others and maintaining a healthy fitness schedule often does not come to mind as a primary importance.
With jam-packed schedules and fast paced lifestyles, many young adults struggle to balance their work and social lives.


## Persona
![Persona](https://github.com/sydnieso/DH150-SydnieSo-FinalProject/blob/master/Persona.png)

## Scenario 1: Selecting a charity & completing a run
#### Context:
It’s a Thursday evening and Kristin just got home from a long day of teaching her middle school students. She doesn’t feel like looking for a workout class to go to and doesn’t want to pay a large amount of money in order to get some exercise. It’s almost time for her to start cooking dinner for her usual dinner time, but she knows that if she doesn’t work out before she has dinner she will not have the motivation to do so afterwards. She decides she wants to go on a run but also realizes that she hasn’t had the time to volunteer and help out charities like she used to before she moved and her schedule became more hectic.

#### Action:
Kristen opens up Charity Miles on her phone and already has 'World Wildlife Fund’ selected as the charity she wants to raise money for. She decides she wants to learn more about the charity and browse other charity options to see what else might be of interest to her. After reading the description of the charity ‘Wounded Warrior Project’ she decides she wants to switch to start raising money for that charity instead. Then, she goes back to the Run page and starts her activity. After about 10 minutes of running she realizes that she had accidentally forgot to feed her dog earlier today, so she quickly runs home and ends her activity feeling slightly rushed but still motivated and excited to get back into an active lifestyle. 

## Scenario 2: Connecting with a new friend
#### Context:
On Saturday Kristen comes home in the late afternoon after a jam-packed morning of recording audition tapes. She thinks about the run she did on Thursday and how it made her feel much better both physically and mentally, but realizes that she is still struggling to meet people after moving to a new city. After deciding that she wants to go on a run again, she also decides that she wants to try out the ‘Connect’ feature that Charity Miles offers in order to go out of her comfort zone and do what she can to meet new people!

#### Action:
Kristen opens up Charity Miles on her phone and goes to the community ‘Connect’ page where she has given access to her general location (indicated in blue) which shows that she is also active to message. She has a filter set to allow people within a 1 mile radius to connect with her and join her on a run. She selects one of the icons of a person nearby and finds out that Alexa is only 0.78 miles away. She decides to message her but sees that she has already received a message from Alexa. They chat and decide to meet at the local coffee shop half-way between their homes before their run.

## Wireframes/Wireflow
Here are some of the wireframe sketches that I developed when starting to create layout improvements for Charity Miles.
![Wireframe Sketch 1](https://github.com/sydnieso/DH150-SydnieSo-FinalProject/blob/master/Wireframe%20Sketch%201.png)
These sketches were the first few drafts that I had created. I got feedback from Professor Cho, stating that it was best to narrow down the functions the app can do based on the main ideas each scenario is striving to complete. In these sketches there are five page buttons on the navigation bar, but as you can see in the next set of sketches I narrowed it down to only have three. There is also a page that indicates activity selection, but after further discussion with Professor Cho, I also decided to make this application solely a running app that raises money for charity.

On this set of wireframe sketches I focused on main frame layouts and created a list of all the pages I wanted to develop and drew them in order from left to right as they would proceed when clicked.

## Interactive Prototype
Here are a few pages of my high fidelity prototype.

## Usability Prototype
A usability test on the latest version of my prototype was conducted. For this test I described the context of each scenario to the partipant and asked her to follow the tasks described within each action/solution section. Click below to watch the usability test on my interactive prototype.
